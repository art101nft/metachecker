              Welcome. </br>
            </br>
              This service is a simple way for NFT project owners to collaborate on the metadata of their collections before applying to contracts on networks. It came about after issues with my own project, where my artist was compiling metadata and images locally, uploading to IPFS, and providing me with a new hash. Our QA checks were very manual and error prone. I would take his IPFS hash, perform <code>curl</code> checks in my Terminal, pipe outputs to <code>jq</code>, and <code>diff</code> the results.</br>

            </br>
              For all of our drops things were a bit haphazard, but during our <a href="https://basedvitalik.io/" target="_blank">BASED VITALIK</a> drop we actually pushed changes which caused underlying images to change. Yikes! This was obviously no good and something we had to improve upon.

              I was inspired by the <a href="https://twitter.com/tubbycatsnft/" target="_blank">Tubby Cats NFT</a> project. They've only shown screenshots of their tool, but they had a similar concept for the development of their artwork; a dashboard where they could collaborate on all the generated artwork to review metadata and art.

            <p>I thought I would develop something for my own project's needs and it wouldn't hurt if others could use it as well.</p>
